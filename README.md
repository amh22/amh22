- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
- I'm a Full Stack / Frontend Engineer with a strong product focus, and a passion for exploring and learning emerging technologies. I enjoy scoping, architecting and building quality solutions to novel and nuanced UI/UX challenges. I'm proactive, and work closely with Design and Product to implement visions via wireframing and rapid prototyping, testing assumptions and iterating often.

- 👀 I have a deep interest in blockchain and AI technology. Actively involved in web3 as both a community member, and a builder. Areas of particular interest are on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, decentralised storage networks, funding of public goods, and the intersection of blockchain and AI.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to store data on the Arweave permaweb using Bundlr and also the Lit protocol for encrypting and decrypting files. I'm also working on an IRL web3 education platform that aims to empower participation in web3 by creating social context for members by connecting them both IRL and on-chain. To do so I am learning how to incorporate verifiable credentials and the Lens protocol to created a trusted community social graph.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 and/or AI projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.
