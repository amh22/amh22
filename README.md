- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
- I'm a Full Stack / Frontend Focused Engineer with an interest in UI design and blockchain technology. I have experience with product design of complex web apps, from scoping to implementation of solutions to novel and nuanced UI and UX challenges. I work closely with Design and Product to implement vision via wireframing and rapid prototyping. I have an innate drive for continuous learning and I am currently learning Solidity.

- 👀 I have a deep interest in blockchain and AI technology. I'm actively involved in web3 as both a community member, and a builder. Areas of particular interest are DeFi, on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, decentralised storage networks, funding of public goods, and the intersection of blockchain and AI.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 and/or AI projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.

- 👀 I have recently worked as a senior frontend engineer with ANZ (The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group) Digital Asset Services team on a web app that provides institutional clients with real world asset tokenisation, portfolio, and marketplace services for
transacting tokenised assets across blockchain networks. For more information on the projects I have worked on please see: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-henry1/

- 👀 I have also recently built a dApp for BricktOrigins by Abnormal Studios - a collection of 5 individual NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain celebrating the history, community, and future of Abnormal Studios. For more details: https://www.gramercystudios.com/work/bricktorigins/

- 📫 I can be reached via email at andrew@gramercystudios.com, on X/Twitter @drewzmh, or via LinkedIn (please see link above).
