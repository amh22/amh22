- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
  
- Full Stack / Frontend Focused Product Software Engineer designing for human-AI interaction and building AI-native web experiences, with a strong interest in blockchain technology.

- Experienced in building autonomous AI agents - both product facing (agent-to-UI integration, creating native agentic interfaces that make AI agent capabilities domain-specific and accessible), and as engineering tooling (automating workflows, pattern recognition, and codifying repetitive tasks). Building with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect agents with external data sources and tools.

- :eyes: I have a deep interest in blockchain and AI technology. I'm actively involved in web3 as both a community member, and a builder. Areas of particular interest are DeFi, on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, decentralised storage networks, funding of public goods, and the intersection of blockchain and AI.

- :revolving_hearts: I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.

- :eyes: In my latest role I was as a full stack engineer with a crypto iGaming casino and sportsbook startup. It was a multi-Faceted role where I spearheaded the admin dashboard development for managing crypto gaming operations, client accounts, and financial transactions, while also contributing to the consumer frontend (Next.js) and backend microservices (Golang). I pioneered AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate delivery from concept to production,  codifing repetitive patterns into documented, autonomous workflows that maintained production standards. I also erved as web3 subject matter expert, providing education and guidance on crypto / web3 integration, and blockchain operations to team members with limited web3 experience.

- :eyes: Recently (Oct 2022 - Jan 2024) I worked as a senior frontend engineer with ANZ (The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group) Digital Asset Services team on a web app that provides institutional clients with real world asset tokenisation, portfolio, and marketplace services for transacting tokenised assets across blockchain networks.

- :robot: I've built a couple of AI-native POCs. One called Mosaic - a platform that transforms static resumes into interactive, queryable personas. The AI speaks in first person, in the owner's voice, with their personality and depth. Visitors ask questions and receive authentic, context-aware responses. Owners edit conversationally ("update my summary to emphasise AI") with an approval flow before changes persist. Give it a try - [Mosaic](https://mosaic-sepia.vercel.app/)

- :robot: The other AI-native POC is called Neo - an autonomous AI agent with a web interface that explores and explains any public GitHub codebase through natural language conversation. Go explore [Neo](https://hello-agent-web.vercel.app/)
  
- :eyes: I have built a dApp for BricktOrigins by Abnormal Studios - a collection of 5 individual NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain celebrating the history, community, and future of Abnormal Studios. For more details: [Bricktorigins](https://www.gramercystudios.com/work/bricktorigins/)
