- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
- I'm a Full Stack / Frontend Focused Engineer with an interest in UI design and blockchain technology. I have experience with product design of complex web apps, from scoping to implementation of solutions to novel and nuanced UI and UX challenges. I work closely with Design and Product to implement vision via wireframing and rapid prototyping. I have an innate drive for continuous learning and I am currently learning Solidity.

- 👀 I have a deep interest in blockchain and AI technology. I'm actively involved in web3 as both a community member, and a builder. Areas of particular interest are DeFi, on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, decentralised storage networks, funding of public goods, and the intersection of blockchain and AI.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 and/or AI projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.

- 👀 My latest project has been the frontend build of a Web3 jobs board with TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS utility classes. Algolia search was integrated and used for instant search querying, and for filtering jobs based
on location, category, type, and years of experience. See: [Web3 Jobs](https://www.web3-jobs.xyz/)

- 👀 Recently (Oct 2022 - Jan 2024) I worked as a senior frontend engineer with ANZ (The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group) Digital Asset Services team on a web app that provides institutional clients with real world asset tokenisation, portfolio, and marketplace services for transacting tokenised assets across blockchain networks. For more information on the projects I have worked on please see: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-henry1/

- 👀 I have also recently built a dApp for BricktOrigins by Abnormal Studios - a collection of 5 individual NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain celebrating the history, community, and future of Abnormal Studios. For more details: https://www.gramercystudios.com/work/bricktorigins/

- 📫 I can be reached via email at andrew@gramercystudios.com, on X/Twitter @drewzmh, or via LinkedIn (please see link above).
