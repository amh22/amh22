- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
- I'm a full stack JavaScript engineer with a strong product focus. I enjoy working closely with stakeholders to understand their domain, identify scope, and map out application architecture. I get involved early in domain modelling, UI wireframing and rapid prototyping, testing assumptions and iterating often. I mostly work with React, Gatsby, Nextjs, GraphQL, Node.js, Ethers, and Solidity.

- 👀 I have a deep interest in blockchain technology and how individuals and enterprises can participate in web3. I'm actively involved in web3 as a both a community member (e.g., a member of the Developer DAO), and a builder. Areas of particular interest are web3 education and community building, DAOs, on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, funding of public goods, decentralised storage, modular blockchain networks, and layer 2 scaling solutions.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to store data on the Arweave permaweb using Bundlr and also the Lit protocol for encrypting and decrypting files. I'm also working on an IRL web3 education platform that aims to empower participation in web3 by creating social context for members by connecting them both IRL and on-chain. To do so I am learning how to incorporate verifiable credentials and the Lens protocol to created a trusted community social graph.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.
