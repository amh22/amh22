- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew.
- Full Stack / Frontend Focused Product Software Engineer designing for human-AI interaction and building AI-native web experiences, with a strong interest in blockchain technology. Experience with product design of complex web apps, from scoping to implementation of solutions to novel and nuanced UI and UX challenges. Works closely with Design and Product to implement vision via rapid prototyping.

- Proficient in AI infrastructure adoption and context engineering, with active exploration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and MCP UI for building AI-native interfaces and rich user experiences that connect models with external data sources and tools. Uses AI for pattern recognition and automation-codifying repetitive tasks into documented workflows that enable autonomous execution to production standards. Approaches AI collaboration through comprehensive documentation and structured methodologies rather than ad-hoc prompting.

- 👀 I have a deep interest in blockchain and AI technology. I'm actively involved in web3 as both a community member, and a builder. Areas of particular interest are DeFi, on-chain identity and verifiable credentials, NFT utility, decentralised storage networks, funding of public goods, and the intersection of blockchain and AI.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 and/or AI projects in the areas of interest mentioned above.

- 👀 In my latest role I was as a full stack engineer with a crypto iGaming casino and sportsbook startup. It was a multi-Faceted role where I spearheaded the admin dashboard development for managing crypto gaming operations, client accounts, and financial transactions, while also contributing to the consumer frontend (Next.js) and backend microservices (Golang). I pioneered AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate delivery from concept to production,  codifing repetitive patterns into documented, autonomous workflows that maintained production standards. I also erved as web3 subject matter expert, providing education and guidance on crypto / web3 integration, and blockchain operations to team members with limited web3 experience.

- 👀 Recently (Oct 2022 - Jan 2024) I worked as a senior frontend engineer with ANZ (The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group) Digital Asset Services team on a web app that provides institutional clients with real world asset tokenisation, portfolio, and marketplace services for transacting tokenised assets across blockchain networks. For more information on the projects I have worked on please see: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-henry1/

- 👀 I have also recently built a dApp for BricktOrigins by Abnormal Studios - a collection of 5 individual NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain celebrating the history, community, and future of Abnormal Studios. For more details: https://www.gramercystudios.com/work/bricktorigins/
